In this Project, we’ll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so we want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, we want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for your portfolio.

So, we’re asked to create a prototype for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

In this Project, we’ll combine our financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that we acquired .

##Technologies : This project leverages Anaconda and Jupyterlab with Python 3.7:

We need also to import the following libraries and dependencies :

```
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from path import Path
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler 
```
## Installation Guide :
The following PIP installation must be performed before running the program. 
They include: 

```pip install -U scikit-learn````


```conda install -c pyviz hvplot```


## Usgae :
The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:
```Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
Visualize and Compare the Results
